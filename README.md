# Odin Recipe Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Odin Recipe Project! This is a simple HTML website project where I will be creating a recipe website using basic HTML tags to structure the content. The project is designed to help you practice and demonstrate the understanding of HTML, laying the foundation for building more complex web applications in the future.

## Project Overview

The Odin Recipe Project is a hands-on exercise that allowed me to apply the knowledge of HTML tags to create a simple yet functional recipe website. The website will include sections for displaying the recipe name, ingredients, instructions, and perhaps an image of the final dish. By completing this project, I will gain practical experience in structuring web content using HTML, creating a cohesive and visually appealing layout.



## Getting Started

To get started with the Odin Recipe Project, simply clone or download the project repository. Open the HTML file in your preferred text editor, and begin adding the necessary HTML tags to create the recipe website. Follow the project instructions and guidelines provided in the documentation.

Feel free to customize the project based on your preferences, experiment with styling using CSS, or even add additional features to make it your own. Have fun coding, and enjoy the process of bringing your recipe website to life!
